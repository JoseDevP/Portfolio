## About Me
I am a software developer specializing in C# and .NET, with a particular focus on backend development and the creation of robust and efficient RESTful APIs. I have experience in various programming techniques, including object-oriented programming, generic programming, functional programming, and concurrency. This variety allows me to approach complex problems from multiple perspectives.

Additionally, I have a strong interest in designing and developing video games, which enables me to bring a creative, user-centered approach to my software projects.

I diligently follow the SOLID principles, guiding my practice to ensure that the code I write is clean, maintainable, and scalable. This not only minimizes long-term issues but also enhances team collaboration, allowing each member to easily understand and contribute to the code.

I prefer to work in an environment where every individual is respected and collaboration is encouraged, creating a space where everyone contributes as part of a whole to achieve the best possible project.
